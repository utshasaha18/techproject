#### What is Hugo?

Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It is optimized for speed, easy use and configurability. Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full html website.

Hugo makes use of Markdown files with front matter for meta data.

A typical website of moderate size can be rendered in a fraction of a second. A good rule of thumb is that Hugo takes around 1 millisecond for each piece of content.

It is written to work well with any kind of website including blogs, tumbles and docs.
