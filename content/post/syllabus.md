# Tech, Data and the Innovation Mindset

Course instructor: Ghislain Mazars, gmazars@ubeeko.com

## Overview

This course explores the profound changes triggered by the emergence of a data-driven economy – from the review of core data technologies to new business approaches developed in the Silicon Valley. The objective is to strengthen students’ abilities to evolve in an increasingly technology minded environment where new rules and methods emerge rapidly.
***
#### To that end, the course:
* Delivers the theoretical tools and perspective to make sense of the evolutions of recent years, and prepare students for the future;
* Integrates an experimental component that will allow students to engage in concrete, practical assignments with a DIY mindset.

***
#### Intended Learning Objectives
This course intends to:

* Provide students with sound reference frameworks to understand and assess the impact of tech and data in today’s economic environment;
* Demystify tech and software through practical (albeit limited-scale) tech assignments;
* Deliver a continuum of knowledge from technology to data-first business models and new managerial
methodologies.

***
#### Key Topics

Part 1: All things software

* “Every company is a software company”
* How open source and GitHub transformed the software industry
* **Tech assignment 1**: Creating the course static web site from open source

Part 2: The modern way of building applications

* Software engineering vs software development
* The key methodologies: Agile, Scrum, Continuous Integration
* **Tech assignment 2**: Improving the site by connecting external services

Part 3: Working with the Cloud

* Fundaments of the Cloud
* The Cloud native stack: the role of Docker and Kubernetes
* **Tech assignment 3**: Deploying in the Cloud

Part 4: Why data matters this much

* The data flywheel concept
* Making sense of Big Data
* **Tech assignment 4**: Tracking users, from data collection to visual analysis

Part 5: Understanding the Silicon Valley mindset

* From the right to fail to Customer development & Lean StartupTM
* Discussion of key intellectual contributions
* **Tech assignment 5**: Making the project future-proof

Part 6: Data-driven Artificial Intelligence

* Understanding machine learning and deep learning
* Business opportunities of AI
* **Tech wrap-up**: What we have achieved together

#### Teaching Methods
The course combines interactive lectures from the instructor with a “learning by doing” methodology for the tech assignments.
***
#### Prerequisites
Prior knowledge of a programming language is NOT a prerequisite for this course. You will not be expected to code, but to rapidly engineer a solution assembling various pre-existing technology components. What absolutely mandatory is:
* A “hands on” attitude: from the initial guidance provided during the class, you will be expected to complete (small) tech assignments with only level 2 instructor support.
* The commitment to actively work on the tech assignments and to support your peers in the process.

#### Grading
Grading is based on both participation and the achievements from the tech assignments.
